**Additional Info & Context**
Any more context that we could use may make the suggestion make more sense to the *N-th* degree (meaning, context like references to sources or other outside information).

Things to remember and look out for:
- This is not a bug/crash report. Use the respective issue templates to report those kinds of issues.
- This mod may not support all mod loaders. You will know if it doesn't if the game crashes and a mod loader says that a certain file is not for it's loader in a crash log.
- Upload code snippets to PasteBin so it doesn't clutter the issue reports page. You can set them to disappear in a week, or longer time, instead of permanently up and public.
